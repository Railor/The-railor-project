Important!
Entity movement using 360* and if moving
Server needs a way to tell client to create an entity of a certain type(way to identify what type a class is and create it)
Server needs to tell client to create new entities, and give them an id,also direction and movement
Server needs to update client Entity location, movement Direction and if object is moving
Client needs to request an entity update(Server decides what to send based on what is near player)

Not as important
Entitiy Wander( Location update, Random direction, if moving)
Server tell client to remove a object
Server checks to see if clients move request is valid, otherwise resends their position(Will stop all players geting stuck)
Fix client not seeing animation of other clients
